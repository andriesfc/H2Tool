# H2Tool

A very stupid wrapper to access all the commands and tools supported by the _H2_ database (as of version 2.2.220).

## Build & Installation

Run the following command:

```bash
./gradlew installDist
```

This will generate a folder which you can to copy the compiled script with a launcher into
the `build/install` folder.

## Usage

To see which commands have been wrapped just run:

```bash
buld/install/bin/h2
```

> **NOTE**: These are just wrapped commands. Please consult the H2 website for details.
